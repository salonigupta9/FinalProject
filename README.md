INST326 Final Project 

Our code runs with a dictionary file named "dict.json". The with statement opens the file and reads it in order for the code to run.
The file stores different names of the actors and their attributes so the users can input different things and the program will run to match from the dictionary and return an actor. 
The output of the program is the name of the actor after the user enters age, ethnicity, and gender stored in the dict file. The conditional statements are used to print the names of the movies the actors have been in and after the user enters yes, the program returns the name of the actor. 

Jasmi Kevadia - with statements and conditional expressions 
Saloni Gupta - list comprehensions and optional parameters and/or use of keyword arguments
